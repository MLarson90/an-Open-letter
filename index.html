        <p>Dear <span class='name'></span>,<br>I am writing you to tell you I love you. I can not imagine my life without you, I feel as though I am trapped in this distant land and it is my only purpose in life to return to you. You are on my mind from the moment I wake until I drift away in the evening. On nights I am luckly you will visit me in my dreams and I wake the following morning with longing for the day those dreams become reality.<span class='name'></span>  do not forget me for I will never forget you.<br>Max "awesome" Larson</p>
